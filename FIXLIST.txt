This is a compilation of things to fix/change later if time allows it.
Add to this list if you have to make a poor design choice in order for
a certain implementation to work properly.

1. unique_ptrs don't work with CardContainers.

2. Have to do a dynamic cast to play a card from the player's hand.

3. There might be a logical error due to APNAP order and on-death triggers
   in the Player class, when it moves a 'dead' minion into the graveyard.
   This seems to suggest that maybe it SHOULD be the card's responsibility
   to move itself between CardContainers. (BIG design issue)




TODOS

4. player indexing exception safety
5. remove those pointless getter/setters
6. remove code redundancies in the transferCard methods
7. create enchantments
